# Developer Kickstart: Advanced Trigger Techniques

This project is an integral part of the Developer Kickstart curriculum at Cloud Code Academy. Designed specifically for budding Salesforce developers, this module delves deep into the realm of triggers, emphasizing advanced best practices, the utility of trigger helpers, and the integration of trigger frameworks.

## Goals of the Practice

During this project, you will enrich your understanding of:
- The pivotal role of advanced trigger best practices in Apex and Salesforce development.
- Designing and implementing trigger helpers to modularize and simplify trigger logic.
- The architecture and utilization of trigger frameworks to create scalable and maintainable triggers.
- The significance of segregating logic into specific contexts (before, after, insert, update) to enhance trigger efficiency.
- The importance of bulkifying triggers to handle multiple records simultaneously, optimizing performance.

By mastering these advanced trigger techniques, you'll augment your capacity to craft sophisticated, efficient, and maintainable triggers. This solidifies your proficiency in harnessing the full potential of Apex triggers, a cornerstone for advanced Salesforce development.

To get started, you'll need a Salesforce Trailhead Playground. If you don't have one, you can create it for free from any Trailhead module.

After you've set up your Trailhead Playground:

1. Install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Install Salesforce Extension Pack in Visual Studio Code. This can be done by searching 'Salesforce Extension Pack' in the Extensions view in VS Code and clicking Install.
3. Authorize your Trailhead Playground in Visual Studio Code. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette and type 'SFDX: Authorize an Org', then press Enter. Follow the steps in the browser to log in to your Playground, then return to VS Code.
4. Deploy the Apex Class by right clicking on the `VariablesDatatypesOperators` and  `VariablesDatatypesOperatorsTest` file a using the option SFDX: Deploy Source to Org.

## Running the Test Classes

To run the test classes:

1. Open the command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P`.
2. Type 'SFDX: Invoke Apex Tests...', and press Enter.
3. In the 'Select Test Class' input, select the test class you want to run and press Enter.
4. The test results will appear in the Output panel at the bottom of the screen. You can switch to the 'Test' tab in this panel to see a summary of the test run.
